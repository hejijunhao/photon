Run a comprehensive code assessment across this entire repository - your objective is to assess the codebase for clean, accurate, functionally sound and maintainable code.
Ignore nice-to-have, optional improvements - priority is on functionality, accuracy, maintainability and clean code.
Files with significantly more than 500 lines of code should be refactored to be more maintainable and readable components - flag those.

End goal is to have a summary of your findings and recommendations (if any) for refactoring parts of the codebase, in markdown format in docs/plans.
