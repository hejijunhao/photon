Run a comprehensive, thorough, methodical review of our entire source code and provide a critical, honest assessment of its quality, functionality, and potential areas for improvement.

Give an overall assessment rating of 1-10, with 10 being the best.

Bear in mind that this will be shared publicly, so the quality has to be objectively standout/exceptional.

Put your assessment/notes into this md file.

And finish off by (A) running a final test of the code, (B) updating the changelog, and (C) updating the README, and (D) giving me clear step by step instructions on how I can test myself manually in a new terminal.
